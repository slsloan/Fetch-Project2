## Project Description
### Overview 
For project two we were tasked at building an app using the MVC paradigm and our own server-side API. We decided on a dog dating app where you could add new dogs to a database and then view the dog's data on a map generated by the GoogleMaps API.
```
AS A dog owner with a lonely dog
I WANT find other single dogs within my area 
SO THAT I can have a new friend for my dog
